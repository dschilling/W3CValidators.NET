Obviously, there is no code here yet, but there will be soon.

== My Goal ==
... to provide two dll's that you can reference in your test projects:
* W3CValidators.dll
* W3CValidators.NUnit.dll

W3CValidators.dll will contain the classes needed to submit files to the
validation web service and to parse the responses.

W3CValidators.NUnit.dll will contain custom NUnit constraints to make it easy to
use the validators from within your unit tests.

== License ==
I don't know what license to use yet.  This is my first open-source project, so I'm not well-versed in the various options.  I'm guessing that whatever license I choose should be able to play nicely with the NUnit license.
