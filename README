= W3CValidators.NET =
This is a .NET library for interacting with the W3C Validators (Markup, CSS, and
Feed), and for doing so within unit tests.

== License ==
See COPYRIGHT for licensing information.  It's the Simplified BSD License that
FreeBSD uses.

== Purpose ==
This .NET library enables you to easily write unit tests that check the validity
of your web-page markup.  The W3C has created a wonderful tool for doing so, and
they encourage the development of language specific libraries that interface
with their API.

== Example ==
Here's what I'm shooting for:

[Test]
public void Default_Page_Should_Output_Valid_Markup()
{
    Assert.That(new Uri("http://localhost/default.aspx"), IsValid.Markup());
}
